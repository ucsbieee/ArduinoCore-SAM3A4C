# Arduino Core for SAM3A4C CPU

This repository contains the source code and configuration files of the Arduino Core for Atmel's SAM3A4C processor (used on the [IEEE Tesla Coil MIDI Interrupter](https://github.com/ucsbieee/Tesla-Coil-MIDI-Synth) board because 2022 chip shortage).

## Installation on Arduino IDE

You'll need to add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucsbieee/ArduinoCore-SAM3A4C/master/package_TC-controller-3A4C_index.json` to the additional boards manager list in Arduino.
